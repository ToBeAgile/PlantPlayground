Reading 2 differential channels in milivolts with a sensor read frequency of 1.
The plant is in a Faraday cage and the Pi 4 is in a Faraday cage inside the Faraday cage with a common ground.
Channel A is connected to a potato in a Faraday cage. Channel B is connected to a plant in a Faraday cage.
"Gain: 1, Data Rate: 1, Volts per Division: 1."
Channels A and B are connected using a silver-silver chloride wire that I made myself.
"Gain: 1, Data Rate: 1, Volts per Division: 1."
